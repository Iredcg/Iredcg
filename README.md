### Hi there 👋
I am Irene da Cruz

### About Me 🧬
I am a researcher with background in genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. I'm currently advancing my skills at WBS Coding School, focusing on Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and key data science techniques. This intensive training has led me to work on varied projects, from Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning to Data Engineering, A/B Testing, and Data Analysis and Visualization using Python and SQL. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in applying computational methods to business datasets creatively and accurately, all viewable on my GitHub. This journey is more than learning new skills; it's about turning complex data into actionable insights.

### Future Goals 🎯
I aim to integrate my genetics and bioinformatics expertise with my evolving data science skills to analyze both biological and non-biological data. Eager to become a Data Scientist or Bioinformatician, I'm dedicated to harnessing data for insights in biology, healthcare, and beyond.
